/**
 * Ledger event shapes — the v0.0.1 contract with the roadmap doc
 * (`research/03-hands-on/05-lo-trinh-paseo-factory.md` §2), as amended by the
 * ADRs. The five §2 events keep their order; the changes on top: every event
 * carries `ts` (ADR 0003), every event after the Contract carries the Attempt
 * number it belongs to (ADR 0003), the Contract fixes the Workspace (ticket 08
 * / ADR 0002 — the Owner chooses where the Gate runs, never the Agent), and
 * `claim_reported` replaces §2's `done_reported` (ADR 0003: the Agent makes a
 * Claim, never "done"). `attempt_accepted` is ADR 0002: only the Owner accepts,
 * and acceptance names one green Attempt. `fresh_eyes_written` is v0.0.2
 * (ticket 03): one advisory line between a green `gate_finished` and its
 * `report_written` — evidence for the Owner, never a second Verdict.
 * The choke events (`permit_allowed` / `permit_denied` / `git_blocked`,
 * v0.0.4) are task-scoped but NOT attempt-scoped: a permit ask belongs to
 * the work before any Claim, and a git block to any moment — so they carry
 * no `attempt`, and `git_blocked` may carry no `task` at all (the shim
 * refuses no matter who runs it; the ledger records what it can bind).
 * The spawn events (`spawn_dispatched` / `spawn_refused`, v0.0.5) are the
 * driver's arrival in the ledger: the plugin records one line per spawn
 * request — allowed or refused — before any agent exists, so they too carry
 * no `attempt` (ADR 0004's amendment: the driver never writes, the plugin
 * validates and records). `watch_written` is v0.0.6 (ticket 03): the
 * record-only Jev pass's one line — it lands beside `fresh_eyes_written`
 * on BOTH verdicts (the stuck-loop battery arm is red by construction),
 * and nothing downstream branches on it (record-only law).
 * `retro_written` is v0.0.7 (ticket 03): the first factory-level event — no
 * task, no attempt, like every Retro line — one per on-demand Retro pass,
 * written only when the pass produced its proposals file (file first, then
 * the line; a refused Retro writes no line at all).
 * `meter_written` is v0.0.8 (ticket 03): the Meter's one line per task per
 * driver run — task-scoped like the spawn lines, because usage spans the
 * whole run. The dollars it carries are live-only truth: the daemon keeps
 * usage in memory per agent and persists it nowhere, so the driver must
 * capture `lastUsage` at the task's terminal moment and submit it through
 * the spool (ADR 0004's third amendment) before the agent dies or the
 * daemon restarts — after that, the fact is gone for good.

 * spawn events; `retro_written` (v0.0.7) closes as the one factory-level
