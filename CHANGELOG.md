## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Verification core v0.0.1 (ticket 07), pure Node with zero Paseo imports:
  - Contract registration (`contract_set`): gate command + required artifact path per task.
  - Append-only `ledger.jsonl` with monotonically increasing `seq`, fsync per line,
    corruption detection on open, and the five roadmap events (`contract_set`,
    `done_reported`, `gate_started`, `gate_finished`, `report_written`).
  - Gate runner: spawns the contract command in the task workspace, captures exit
    code and a capped stdout tail, kills the process group after a timeout, and
    requires the artifact to exist for a green verdict.
  - Report generation: `report-<task>.md` rendered from the ledger — contract,
    agent's claim @ SHA, gate verdict, conclusion — every line traceable to a
    ledger event.
