 * gate_finished.sha, verdict ← the gate verdict, the eye's line ←
 * fresh_eyes_written, the watch's line ← watch_written. Timestamps come from
 * events, not render time (ADR 0003); the header carries the moment the Verdict
 * was established. The report states evidence and stops there: green is not
 * acceptance (ADR 0002), so no line concludes "DONE" — and the eye's and
 * watch's lines, when present, sit between the Verdict and the closing
 * language as evidence, never as a second verdict.
