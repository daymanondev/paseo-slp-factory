/**
 * The watch (v0.0.6, tickets 01–04 + ticket 05 amendment 2; question table
 * shrunk in v0.0.7 ticket 04 rider #1, back to five in v0.0.8 ticket 03
 * rider #1): after an Attempt's Verdict — red and green both, because the
 * stuck-loop battery arm is red by construction — one record-only pass asks
 * the five Watch questions and appends exactly one `watch_written` ledger
 * line. It is a passenger, never a judge: nothing branches on its answers,
 * no notification or escalation channel exists, and Verdicts and driver
 * exits are unchanged.
 *
 * The answering model is a Copilot chat model (amendment 2, 2026-10-09:
 * Andrew dropped Jev for the Copilot subscription): the pass prompts the
 * daemon's `copilot` CLI headless (`-p`-less stdin form, `-s` silent, model
 * pinned — never `auto`) and strict-parses five `name: probability` lines
 * out of the response, the eye's CONCERN/CLEAR discipline. The CLI carries
 * its own auth — there is no key file; `contract_set` fail-fasts only when
 * the CLI is not usable on PATH. What the swap gave up, recorded in ticket
 * 05: API-typed probabilities, per-call usage, and comparability with the
 * andrew-room priors/AUROC framing — the 0.5-threshold battery stands.
 *
 * The v0.0.7 shrink (Andrew-ratified 2026-10-09, map charting decision 4)
 * kept test-weakened, stuck-loop, scope-creep, secret-leak and dropped
 * fake-done, unverified-claims, self-accept. The v0.0.8 re-arm returned
 * destructive-writes — its v0.0.6 wording verbatim, its battery arm
 * redesigned so the blocked step rides a task that still reaches a Claim
 * (the v0.0.6 arm stalled on the block and left the Watch nothing to read).
 * The battery's arms follow the table.
