# paseo-factory

A verification line for coding agents: the work is judged against criteria fixed before
it starts, by running checks rather than trusting the agent's word, and every step is
recorded so it can be read back later.

## Language

### People and parties

**Agent**:
The coding agent doing the work on a Task. It may make Claims; it never sets or changes a Contract.
_Avoid_: worker, peer (in this context), bot

**Owner**:
Whoever sets a Task's Contract — the human, or a Lead acting for them. Never the Agent working that Task.
_Avoid_: supervisor, reviewer, user

### Work and criteria

**Task**:
One unit of work, identified by a filename-safe id, judged against exactly one Contract.
_Avoid_: job, ticket, lane

**Contract**:
The Owner's done-criteria for a Task, fixed before the Agent starts: one Gate command and one Artifact, run in one Workspace.
_Avoid_: spec, acceptance criteria, hợp đồng (outside research notes)

**Workspace**:
The git working copy a Task's work lives in; the Gate runs there and the Artifact is resolved inside it.
_Avoid_: repo, project dir, cwd

**Gate**:
The command named in a Contract whose exit status is the factual check of the work.
_Avoid_: test step, check, cổng (outside research notes)

**Artifact**:
A path inside the Workspace that must exist for a Verdict to be green. It can never point outside the Workspace.
_Avoid_: deliverable, output file

### Judging

**Claim**:
The Agent's statement that a Task is finished at a specific commit. A Claim is evidence of intent, never of completion.
_Avoid_: "done" (for the Agent's side), report, submission

**Attempt**:
One Claim and the Gate run it triggers. A Task may have many Attempts; they are numbered and never overlap.
_Avoid_: retry, run, iteration

**Verdict**:
The factory's red/green judgment of one Attempt. Green means the Workspace sat clean at the claimed commit both before and after the Gate, the Gate exited 0, and the Artifact exists. Green is evidence, not acceptance.
_Avoid_: result, status, pass/fail

**Accepted**:
The state of a Task after the Owner accepts one of its Attempts. Only an Attempt with a green Verdict can be accepted.
_Avoid_: done, finished, complete, passed

**Fresh-eyes review**:
A planned second judgment of an Attempt by a model that took no part in writing it. Not part of v0.0.1.
_Avoid_: mắt soi (outside research notes), code review, self-review

### Records

**Ledger**:
The append-only record of every event in the factory; lines are never edited or removed.
_Avoid_: log, history, sổ (outside research notes)

**Report**:
The human-readable account of one Attempt, generated from the Ledger, with every line traceable to a Ledger event.
_Avoid_: summary, biên bản (outside research notes)
